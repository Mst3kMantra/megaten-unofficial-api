***REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED******REMOVED*** Megaten API(Unofficial)

Made with Node.js, express, and mongoose.
An unofficial API that connects to a MongoDB database storing all the data for the frontend of the MegatenDex app.

Thanks to [Megaten Fusion Tools](https://github.com/aqiu384/megaten-fusion-tool) for all of the extensive data they have collected and to the various sources that they got their data from.
